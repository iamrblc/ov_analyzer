# The Victor Orban Speech Scraper

## The idea
The communication team of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban recently started to upload his speeches and statements more or less consistently on his website, so I created a webscraper that gathers these in a Pandas dataframe for further analysis.

## Future goals
Currently I'm working on general statistics functions and also on sentiment analysis and their visualizations. Once I publish my article I will make the code accessible to everyone. 

## Can I use the scraper?
Absolutely! However, if you are a journalist, content creator or just a fan of the Prime Minister who want to share the results publically, please, quote me.
The ov_scrape.py contains the necessary code (the functions are stored in the ov_functions package. 
The dataframes folder contains a very basic dataframe of the currently available speeches with the following information: date, source, title, text. 

If you got stuck, I'm happy to help.
